# Assumptions

The page appears to be some sort of an order page. So, let's assume that we're working on an MVP for a startup targeted towards working IT professionals, primarily developers / devops.

Something like sentry.io but smaller, think deadmanssnitch.com or cronitor.io - a simple service for fellow developers.

# Thoughts

Since our resources are very limited (we're building an MVP and clearly can't afford a graphic designer), I would use a decent CSS framework so we don't need to design all the elements. Bootstrap is overused, but Material design still looks somewhat fresh and is something our target audience is definitely familiar with.
